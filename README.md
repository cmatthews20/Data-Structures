# Data-Structures

This repo is for exercises in data structures (and in some cases, re-creating certain structures from scratch)

BTree: Creation of BTree structure and basic operations. Includes helper functions such as insertNonFull and splitChild.

arrayList: Full class with  Array list implementations and complete operations (initialization, insertion, delete,
binary search). Class accepts any type of data (templates). Test code is provided.

doublyLinkedList: Entire DLL implementation and test code.

genericNumOperations: Class template to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two variables num1 and num2. Test code provided.

linkedList: Entire SLL implementation (including reversal) and test code.

printMaxVal: Program that finds max of integral data set. Includes user input with the test code.

priorityQueue: Priority queue generic class implementation and test code (enqueue, dequeue, merge).

recursion: Prints first 50 natural numbers using recursion, but is generalized for other 'print first _ numbers' cases. Also includes a function for computing GCD using recursion. Test code included.

stackCalculator: Program that calculates mathematical expressions using the STL stack data structure. Test code provided.

swap: Generic function for swapping two variables using pointers
